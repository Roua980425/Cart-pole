# Introduction
In this project we aim to train the agent to balance a CartPole which is a game in which you try to balance the pole as long as possible. It is assumed that at the tip of the pole, there is an object which makes it unstable and very likely to fall over. The goal of this project is to move the cart left and right so that the pole can stand (within a certain angle) as long as possible.
The longer you keep the pole standing, the more score you will get. The game is over when the pole exceeds 12-degree angle or the cart is going out of the screen.
